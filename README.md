# Tourists_Alternativ_Buildings_MU
 This mod adds alternative buildings for the hotel and the bar (shift+V)
	-> with upcoming updates all multibuildings from the Tourist Season will get an alternative building.
	
Furthermore it adds a historic train station, "Historic Train Station Warehouse", which takes over the function of a warehouse to improve the cityscape a bit
	-> This building buffs:
	
		hotels : max +105 more tourists
			 ->  each +15 more by :
				 Tourist harbour
				 restaurants
				 Variety
				 Jam
				 Café
				 Shampoo
				 Bar
				
		Bars / restaurants / cafés / all shopping arcades / all chemical factories :
			-> +15% higher production each
			   each -25% labour force
				
	the building has intentionally no decal, in order not to stand in the way of the freedom of design and can be built on and over as desired.
	there is space for 3 rail entrances and exits (or roads, as you like) at the sides.
	and in the middle of each of the main entrances for a street (or whatever you prefer).
	
	there is no big deco and no people etc. in the course of the game there is so much going on that it is not needed.
	
In addition, there are also passages which have been created by chance.
	-> one time for double roads
	   one time for single roads
		
		
	also these ornaments have no decal.
	
	I wish you a lot of fun with it and hope you like it and it is useful in the game.
